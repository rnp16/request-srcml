Score: 82

* Left TODO messages -3
* Does not compile: It is std::cerr, not std::err -10
* Messy indentation -2
* Sometimes you return the filename, sometimes you set it. Decide which way and stick to it.
* Why use a block for the then part, and not a block for the else part? Especially since each (then, else) only contain one statement?
* Error messages do not follow those in the assignment -3
